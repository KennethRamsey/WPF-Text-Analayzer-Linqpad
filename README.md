# WPF-Text-Analyzer-Linqpad
Linqpad script to let you write arbitrary rules to highlight a text file and more easily analyze its patterns and outliers.

I would use this script to help me read and analyze complex bank statements so I could write parsers for the file to get the specific transactions we wanted for our system. It's very good for finding lines that could also break your parser.
